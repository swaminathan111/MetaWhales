# RAG API Integration Guide

## üéØ Overview

The CardSense AI chat has been enhanced with RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) integration to provide more accurate and personalized credit card recommendations. The system now uses your specialized credit card knowledge base API at `https://cardsense-ai.vercel.app/api/query` for superior responses.

## üöÄ What's New

### **Enhanced AI Service Architecture**
- **Primary Service**: RAG API with detailed credit card knowledge
- **Fallback Service**: OpenRouter for general AI assistance  
- **Intelligent Routing**: Automatically switches between services based on availability
- **Context Preservation**: Full conversation history maintained across all services

### **Key Features**
1. **Specialized Credit Card Knowledge**: Direct access to your comprehensive credit card database
2. **Smart Fallback System**: Seamless switching to backup AI if RAG is unavailable
3. **Service Status Monitoring**: Real-time indicators showing which AI service is active
4. **Conversation Persistence**: All interactions saved to Supabase database
5. **Enhanced User Experience**: Better, more accurate credit card recommendations

## üì° API Integration Details

### **RAG API Endpoint**
```
POST https://cardsense-ai.vercel.app/api/query
Content-Type: application/json
```

### **Request Format**
```json
{
  "messages": [
    {"role": "user", "content": "which card to use to book a movie ticket"},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Based on your spending patterns..."},
    {"role": "user", "content": "what about online shopping?"}
  ],
  "stream": false
}
```

### **Response Handling**
The integration handles multiple response formats:
- JSON objects with `content`, `message`, `response`, or `text` fields
- Plain text responses
- Streaming responses (when `stream: true`)

## üîß Technical Implementation

### **New Services Added**

#### **1. RagChatService** (`lib/features/chat/services/rag_chat_service.dart`)
- Direct integration with your RAG API
- Supports both streaming and non-streaming responses
- Comprehensive error handling and logging
- Connection testing capabilities

#### **2. EnhancedChatService** 
- Intelligent service routing (RAG ‚Üí OpenRouter fallback)
- Maintains conversation context across service switches
- Service availability monitoring

#### **3. ServiceStatusIndicator** (`lib/features/chat/widgets/service_status_indicator.dart`)
- Real-time status display in chat header
- Visual indicators for active service type
- Detailed service status dialog

### **Updated Components**

#### **Chat Persistence Service**
- Now uses `EnhancedChatService` instead of direct OpenRouter
- Automatic RAG model selection for better responses
- Enhanced conversation title generation

#### **Home Screen**
- Integrated service status indicator
- Visual feedback for AI service type
- RAG test screen access (debug mode)

## üé® User Interface Enhancements

### **Service Status Indicators**
- üü¢ **Enhanced AI**: RAG service active (green indicator)
- üü† **Basic AI**: Fallback service active (orange indicator)  
- üî¥ **AI Offline**: No services available (red indicator)

### **Chat Header**
- Service status badge with clickable details
- Visual distinction between enhanced and basic responses
- Service availability monitoring

## üß™ Testing & Debugging

### **RAG Test Screen**
Access via the orange debug button (üêõ) on the home screen:

**Features:**
- Direct RAG API connectivity testing
- Predefined credit card query testing
- Service availability monitoring
- Real-time response analysis

**Test Queries:**
- "Which card should I use for movie tickets?"
- "What are the best cashback credit cards in India?"
- "Which card gives the most rewards for online shopping?"
- "Help me choose between HDFC Regalia and SBI Prime card"

### **Service Monitoring**
```dart
// Check service availability
final availability = ref.watch(chatServiceAvailabilityProvider);
// Returns: {'rag': true/false, 'openrouter': true/false}
```

## üîÑ Fallback Mechanism

### **Automatic Failover**
1. **Primary**: RAG API called first for all requests
2. **Fallback**: If RAG fails, automatically switches to OpenRouter
3. **User Notification**: Fallback responses include service indicator
4. **Context Preservation**: Full conversation history maintained during switches

### **Error Handling**
- Network connectivity issues
- API rate limiting
- Service downtime
- Invalid response formats

## üìä Expected Improvements

### **Response Quality**
- **Before**: Generic AI responses about credit cards
- **After**: Specific recommendations based on your credit card database
- **Context**: Better understanding of Indian credit card market
- **Personalization**: Responses tailored to user's existing cards

### **User Experience**
- More accurate card recommendations
- Better spending category analysis
- Detailed reward comparisons
- Real-time service status feedback

## üöÄ Deployment Checklist

### **Before Going Live**
1. ‚úÖ Remove debug floating action button from home screen
2. ‚úÖ Verify RAG API endpoint is stable and scaled
3. ‚úÖ Test fallback mechanism thoroughly
4. ‚úÖ Monitor service availability in production
5. ‚úÖ Set up logging and error monitoring

### **Environment Configuration**
```dart
// Production configuration
static const String _baseUrl = 'https://cardsense-ai.vercel.app/api/query';

// For different environments, you can use:
// Development: 'https://dev-cardsense-ai.vercel.app/api/query'
// Staging: 'https://staging-cardsense-ai.vercel.app/api/query'
```

## üîß Troubleshooting

### **Common Issues**

#### **RAG API Not Responding**
- Check network connectivity
- Verify API endpoint URL
- Check service status in test screen
- Review logs for error details

#### **Fallback Not Working**
- Verify OpenRouter API key configuration
- Check CORS settings
- Test individual services separately

#### **Context Loss**
- Ensure conversation history is being passed correctly
- Check database persistence settings
- Verify message format conversion

### **Debug Commands**
```dart
// Test RAG connectivity
final ragService = ref.read(ragChatServiceProvider);
await ragService.testConnection();

// Check service availability  
final availability = await ref.read(enhancedChatServiceProvider)
    .checkServiceAvailability();

// Get health status
final health = await ragService.getHealthStatus();
```

## üìà Monitoring & Analytics

### **Key Metrics to Track**
- RAG API response time
- Success/failure rates
- Fallback frequency
- User satisfaction with responses
- Service availability uptime

### **Logging Points**
- API request/response cycles
- Service switching events
- Error conditions
- Response quality indicators

## üîÆ Future Enhancements
